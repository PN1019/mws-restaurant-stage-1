#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

 In Stage Two, you will take the responsive, accessible design you built in Stage One and connect it to an external server. You’ll begin by using asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. You’ll store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet performance benchmarks, which you’ll test using Lighthouse.



### Installation Instructions 

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/PN1019/mws-restaurant-stage-2">server</a>
2. Start server by running `node server` on root folder of server.
3. Download this repo.
4. Start http-server by running `http-server . -p 8000` on project root folder.
5. Navigate to `localhost:8000` to view the app in browser.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
